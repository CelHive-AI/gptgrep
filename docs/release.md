# Native binary releases

The release package contains the native Rust CLI and the exact PDFium library needed for local PDF parsing. It does not require Node, Bun, Python, a vector database, or an MCP service at runtime. The optional `gptgrep-ai` incur wrapper is a separate source package. Office conversion still needs an existing LibreOffice installation; OCR is disabled in this build.

The initial package targets are `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. macOS ARM64 is the local development host. A configured Linux job is not evidence of a successful Linux run; platform validation is established by that target's completed native CI and archive smoke receipt. macOS binaries are unsigned and not notarized. Linux compatibility is with the runner/build environment used for that release, not a promise of arbitrary older glibc support. Windows, macOS Intel, Linux ARM64 and musl artifacts are outside this release set.

## Package an existing native build

Python 3.12 or later, Cargo and a native build environment are packaging tools. Pass every binary input explicitly. The script does not search a developer home directory or download native dependencies.

```sh
cargo build --release --locked -p gptgrep-cli
python3 scripts/package_release.py \
  --binary target/release/gptgrep \
  --pdfium-dir /path/to/unmodified/extracted/pdfium \
  --target aarch64-apple-darwin \
  --output dist/release --require-clean --smoke-test
```

Use the corresponding native Linux target on Linux. `--require-clean` requires an actual committed source revision and a clean tree. Omit it only for local preparation; the metadata then records the actual dirty/uncommitted status and cannot pass publication checks. The script checks the native binary's version and architecture, rejects existing output filenames, and publishes its local files only after the requested checks pass.

PDFium is pinned to [`chromium/8058`](https://github.com/run-llama/pdfium-binaries/releases/tag/chromium/8058), whose release-source commit is [`f15f55200f695a13c2ca3aab35f8aa40a596b2f7`](https://github.com/run-llama/pdfium-binaries/tree/f15f55200f695a13c2ca3aab35f8aa40a596b2f7). The package script validates the exact library plus `LICENSE`, `VERSION` and every file in `licenses/` against a recorded payload digest. A modified or incomplete payload fails. In particular, a build helper may rewrite a cached macOS dylib's install name; use the original extracted release artifact for packaging. Release workflows separately verify the downloaded archive before extracting it.

| Target | Upstream asset | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| macOS ARM64 | `pdfium-mac-arm64.tgz` | `df8d1016fc36c2651b368ca13b992ae3bb6b6020d12f2d24443bf13cf76ea593` |
| Linux x86_64 | `pdfium-linux-x64.tgz` | `2dd418a8974dbb373ad281f99b6f95ed02e01b1a2bb2e05e772c80b7587577b5` |

The `.tar.gz` has one top-level directory:

```text
gptgrep-VERSION-TARGET/
  gptgrep                 shell launcher; preserves arguments and exit status
  gptgrep.bin             native executable
  lib/libpdfium.*         native PDFium library
  LICENSE
  THIRD_PARTY.md
  licenses/               retained project notices and source supplements
  third-party/pdfium/     original LICENSE, VERSION and complete licenses/
  third-party/rust/       actual Rust dependency license/notice files and inventory
  RELEASE.json            source revision, target, version and payload digests
  SHA256SUMS              checksums of all bundle files except this checksum file
```

The launcher resolves its own location, including a bounded symlink chain, and sets `PDFIUM_LIB_PATH` to the bundle's absolute `lib` directory for the child process. Paths with spaces and original CLI arguments are preserved. Move the whole bundle; moving only `gptgrep.bin` removes the launcher guarantee. `GPTGREP_TRACE_LIBRARIES=1` enables loader diagnostics for relocation verification. It is not necessary for normal use.

Each archive also has `.tar.gz.sha256`, `.release.json`, and, when requested, `.smoke.json` sidecars. `--smoke-test` extracts the real archive into a separate path containing spaces, exercises original synthetic PDF and plaintext documents, verifies fresh citations, and checks that only PDF parsing loads the bundled PDFium library. The smoke process makes no model calls. Shared caches are never renamed or deleted. Archive file ownership and timestamps are normalized; this does not by itself establish byte-identical Rust builds across toolchains.

## Actual dependency license files

`scripts/collect_licenses.py` reads `cargo metadata --locked --format-version 1 --filter-platform TARGET` and follows normal/build dependency edges from `gptgrep-cli`. Development-only edges are excluded. It copies actual package/repository `LICENSE`, `COPYING`, `COPYRIGHT` and `NOTICE` files and license directories. SPDX expressions remain declarations in the inventory; they are not substituted for license texts. Packaging fails if an actual license payload is unavailable.

```sh
python3 scripts/collect_licenses.py --target aarch64-apple-darwin \
  --output .local/license-audit --require-complete
```

Some published crates omit their upstream license files. The version-bound files under `licenses/rust-supplements/` retain exact source text, SHA-256, Git blob identity, the package's `.cargo_vcs_info.json` revision and primary source URL. They are admitted only for the matching installed package revision. For `simd_helpers` 0.1.0, the original package commit omitted `LICENSE`; the author's next commit only adds that file, and the compiled source blob is unchanged. Both revisions and the one-file comparison are recorded explicitly. Zune's full Zlib text is retained alongside its upstream alternative-license notice; the notice is not presented as the full MIT or Apache text.

No local dependency-cache paths, private session identities or credentials are written into release metadata or license inventories.

## CI and publication

The first experimental release is gated on a real paired PageIndex-OSS-Benchmark
result showing a minimum verified advantage over PageIndex Flash plus GPT-5.6.
The complete GPTgrep system must use its required Jev retrieval and local Codex
workflow. Source delivery, CI, transport smokes and tree-only controls do not
satisfy this gate. Preserve task denominators, actual profiles, build/search costs,
failures, citation checks and the matching source revisions. The comparison rule
is defined in [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) and the project goal contract. Do not create or
push the first release tag while G5 remains unaccepted.

CI runs native Rust formatting, workspace tests, Clippy with denied warnings, the offline retrieval evaluation, its oracle tests, packaging self-tests, and complete license collection on both targets. A separate job tests the locked optional incur package. The PDFium archive is checksum-verified before use. The official runner table lists `macos-14` as ARM64 and `ubuntu-latest` as x86_64; jobs still verify native target artifacts. [GitHub runner reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners)

The release workflow runs on an existing `vVERSION` tag or a manual dispatch naming that tag. It binds the tag to the Cargo workspace version and exact source revision, runs CI against that revision, builds each native artifact, collects licenses, packages and runs relocation tests, then publishes only after both targets succeed. Only the final publish job has `contents: write`. Checkout credentials are not persisted. The workflow does not publish to crates.io or npm, create a source tag, replace existing release assets, sign binaries or notarize macOS executables. Prerelease version tags produce GitHub prereleases.

Independent source review and project closeout precede the tag push. Preparing these workflow files or passing local checks does not establish that a hosted workflow or public release has run. Triggering the release workflow is a publication action; the project owner performs it after checking the concrete source and retained results.

Action references were resolved from the primary GitHub tag APIs and pinned to actual commit objects on September 22, 2026. The annotated pnpm tag was dereferenced to its commit. The Rust action is pinned to the observed `stable` action commit while the compiler itself is explicitly 1.96.0.
